# YouTube Party

## note: current build is not connected to YouTube API.

Idea: Music at a party is a must, but guests don't want to keep getting up and requesting songs of the host/DJ. This app lets users submit songs from YouTube to a central playlist operated by a host/DJ. Host/dj creates a private room that users can log in via a private room code.

Not a production app.
This app was a group project to put into practice the fundamentals of React, Redux, React-Router, Bootstrap/Reactstrap.
